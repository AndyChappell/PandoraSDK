TAG V00-14
************************************************************************
Add algorithm tool functionality.
Add vertex to ParticleFlowObject class.
Add ability to make pfo parent-daughter associations.
Add ability to create pfos containing no clusters or tracks, but which can hold metadata and daughter pfos.
XmlHelper algorithm and tool creation improvements.
Changes for clang build on Mavericks.

TAG V00-13
************************************************************************
Upgrade handling of relationships between mc particles and calohits/tracks.
Instead of associating the single mc particle representing the largest energy contribution, client applications can now provide the relationships as a series of weighted contributions.
Calohits and tracks now hold a map of mc particles to weights (typically energy contribution). Previous functionality is restored if an algorithm uses the GetMainMCParticle methods.
Add UseSingleMCParticleAssociation configuration option, so that, for every calohit/track, MCManager only keeps track of the mc particle association with the largest weight.

TAG V00-12 FOR ILCSOFT USAGE
************************************************************************
Updated Pandora persistency, with separate binary and xml file writers and readers.
Relaxed restriction on merging a cluster with a parent cluster that happens to already be part of a PFO.
Provided opportunity to receive address of newly-constructed PFOs in algorithms.
Ensured local include directory is first in include path.

TAG V00-11 FOLLOWING REPOSITORY RESTRUCTURING
************************************************************************
Up to V00-11, the PandoraSDK was the core part of the PandoraPFANew parent package.
PandoraPFANew is now a "metadata" package containing only Makefiles for downloading and building relevant Pandora libraries.
The PandoraSDK is now maintained and released separately.

GENERAL INFO:
Pandora consists of the PandoraSDK (Software Development Kit), which comprises a single library and header files with flexible APIs.
There is also an optional PandoraMonitoring library, which contains event display and tree/histogram-writing functionality.
The PandoraMonitoring library depends on the PandoraSDK and ROOT.
Pandora algorithms will necessarily depend upon the PandoraSDK (and also PandoraMonitoring, if desired).
The algorithms can be built as part of a Pandora client application, such as MarlinPandora, or the standalone TestPandora binary.
Algorithms declared to be suitably generic may be designed for use by multiple client applications.
Such re-usable algorithms are best bundled together into a Pandora "content" library.
Algorithms are always registered via the client application, using the PandoraAPIs, but the client app can link against as many content libraries as required.
